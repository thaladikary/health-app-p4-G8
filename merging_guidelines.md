# Merging Guidelines

## Branching

- Create descriptive branches for your work (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).
- **Never work directly on the main branch**.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

- Use clear PR titles and descriptions.
- Include detailed testing instructions.
- Assign a reviewer for code inspection.

## Testing

- Thoroughly test your changes before creating a PR.
- Run automated tests when applicable.

## Review Process

- Reviewers evaluate code quality and functionality.
- Provide constructive feedback for improvement.
- PR approval is required before merging.

## Merging

- Only maintainers or team leads can merge PRs.
- Squash commits into descriptive summaries.
- Rebase your branch on the latest main branch before merging.
