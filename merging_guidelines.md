# Merging Guidelines

## Branching

- Create descriptive branches for your work (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).
- **Never work directly on the main branch**.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

- Use clear PR titles and descriptions.
- Include detailed testing instructions.
- Assign a reviewer for code inspection.

## Review Process

- Reviewers evaluate code quality and functionality.
- Provide constructive feedback for improvement.
- PR approval is required before merging. When done, comment "lgtm + pull request ID". lgtm (Looks good to me)

## Merging

- Once it has been reviewed, we can now merge it to parent branch.
